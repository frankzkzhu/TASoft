On December 11, 2022
- While ideas for cross model integration greatly improves consistentcy, it hasn't achieved desired results for cross model integration itself yet. Still hopeful that cross model integration will make forecasting perfection as normal and inaccuracy as anomaly!

On December 5, 2022
- Published TAsoft LLC Stock Forecasting on youtube to kick off the mini series of TASoft LLC stock forecasting!

On November 15, 2022
- With much more consistent forecasting results and theoretical understanding, our time series theory now has established sound theoretical foundation both from theoretical and practical perspective! It is also openning a door for human being to unlock the mystery of future!

On October 24. 2022
- While future solutions are not perfect deterministic, but with some distribution, the algorithm itself with this built in intrinsically is essential for success! And for that, we has success. Therefore forecasting itself has some small noise!

On October 24, 2022
- Future solutions on time series is now complete! With this new understandings, hopefully it could shed new light on understanding of time dimension as well!

On October 18, 2022
- Through further ubderstanding forecasting mechanisms, it becomes increasingly clear that forecasting future is deterministic, in worst case scenario, with small number of variations!

On October 14, 2022
- Completion of solution leads to forecasting index fund with increasing accuracy, TASoft LLC will add service to fund managers on 401k investment as well!

On October 2, 2022
- With cross model integration, the mathematical solution is now complete! While future could be still not deterministic, it becomes more interesting to find out the future paths and understandings!

On September 26, 2022
- Interestingly, most of the stock futures trend with its associated industry sector. And futhermore, sector index fund forecasting is largely deterministic even without model crossover.

On September 24, 2022
- Currently it appears that stock market index forecasting is not deterministic. It did slide into different model. However, thinking in subspace of linear algegra suggests that with cross model integration it will bridge the gap, and therefore it is likely deterministic in the end!!

On August 30, 2022
- With time series forecasting science, it is possible to build economic control parameters in the model and forecasting will tell its imapct. It is no longer guess but with scientific precision.

On August 26, 2022
- The Fed influences the market or the market influences the Fed. The later probably has more weight. After all the market future is deterministic!

On August 23, 2022
- After several weeks observation, it appears that index fund future forecasting is very much like deterministic!

On July 19, 2022
- With multithreading and code improvements (speed up 40x), it is likely the entire US market can be cycled on two decent laptop within a week! 

On July 2, 2022
- Moving to multithreading, computing power boosted beyond 10x! The production line is speeding up!

On July 1, 2022
- Nowdays Laptop's power is in parallelism. Forturnately, timeseries forecasting is parallel in nature! After week's work, forecasting software is now fully exploiting muti-threading power!

On June 26, 2022
- TASoft LLC will open a youtube channel to explain TASoft LLC forecasting!

On June 26, 2022
- TASoft LLC announced that entire US stock forecasting data is accessible for special business partners! https://www.tasoft.net/services/partner.html

On June 22, 2022
- It seems now that with the time series forecasting, it is possible to study its future deterministicness which seems impossible in the past! This is just interpretations of forecasting results.

On June 13, 2022
- It is observed that sometimes forecasting on certain ticks shows two complete opposite trending directions.  Is stock future deterministic? This research topic might warrant stock future study/understanding!
  
On June 12, 2022
- TASoft LLC is considering to open a youtube channel offering forecasting based market analysis. Stay tuned!

On June 10, 2022

On May 24, 2022
- Published Index Fund FMAT on TASoft LLC Website!

On May 18, 2022
- It seems like parallel processing is the only way to boost the computing process to scale the comupting demands despite the recent acquisition of decent computing device. One more hurdle to the production line!

On May 14, 2022
- The recent downturn even provides good ROI opportunities for Medium Cap Stocks and worthy for short term forecasting!

On May 11, 2022
- The recent market downturn creates great opportunity to test the forecasting scenarios and tests the forecasting strength on high accuracy forecasting and its QA process! 

On May 10, 2022
- Planning to add forecasting on some sector index etf fund, such as  biotechnology,healthcare and energy!

On May 5,2022
- One thing I learned about machine learning in the time series forecasting endeavor is: First, machine learning is just a tool, itself will not solve problems. Second, if machine learning really advances, it needs to be open box and be understandable. While there are so much hype about DeepLearning because of its success in image recognization, its further advance will be limited because it is opaque and closed system.

On May 4,2022
- While the first generation of stock forecasting demonstrates impressive consistency, the second generation solution shows even better accuracy and consistency. Of course, it is all well explained under scientific context while our production is still under the way!!

On April 26, 2022
